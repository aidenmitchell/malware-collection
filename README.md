# malware-collection

This is a collection of malware I've encountered, sorted by file type/extention.

Each individual file is zipped along with a README (with some file info) and any other pertinant files (for example, a .pdf of the malicious email used to deliver the malware.)


## Emails

If an email was used to deliver the malware in any way (attached, linked, or otherwise), the email will be included in .pdf format.

The emails are sanitized to remove links and headers.
To sanitize them:
1. The .eml is downloaded.
2. The macOS Mail app is used to print the email to PDF.
3. The "printed" PDF is run through [Dangerzone](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone).
